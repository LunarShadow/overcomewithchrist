## Who we are

We are [Overcome with Christ](www.overcomewithchrist.com).

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact forms

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

## Who we share your data with

We share information with third parties who help us provide our orders and store services to you such as Stripe. 

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
If you buy a product, your name and email are retrained until you unsubscribe from the mailing list. 
For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

## Your contact information

When contacting us, only your email and information that you provide is used to respond to your message. \
Other information provided when ordering is used to fulfill your order and may be sent to a third-party fulfillment company.

## Store

We collect information about you during the checkout process on our store.

While you visit our site, we’ll track:

* Products you’ve viewed: we’ll use this to, for example, show you products you’ve recently viewed
* Location, IP address, and browser type: we’ll use this for purposes like estimating taxes and shipping
* Shipping address: we’ll ask you to enter this so we can, for instance, estimate shipping before you place an order, and send you the order!

We’ll also use cookies to keep track of cart contents while you’re browsing our site.

When you purchase from us, we’ll ask you to provide information including your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, phone number, credit card/payment details, and optional account information like username and password. We’ll use this information for purposes, such as, to:

* Send you information about your account and order
* Respond to your requests, including refunds and complaints
* Process payments and prevent fraud
* Set up your account for our store
* Comply with any legal obligations we have, such as calculating taxes
* Improve our store offerings
* Send you marketing messages, if you choose to receive them

We generally store information about you for as long as we need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we will store order information for 2 years for tax and accounting purposes. This includes your name, email address, and billing and shipping addresses.

We will also store comments or reviews if you choose to leave them.
