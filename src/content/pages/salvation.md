        Remember what it says: &ldquo;Today when you hear his voice,
        don&apos;t harden your hearts as Israel did when they rebelled&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <cite>Hebrews 3:15</cite>

Salvation is a simple process because Jesus already did all the work.
All you have to do is confess out loud that Jesus is Lord and that God
raised him from the dead (Romans 10:9-10).
