I created this blog to share with the world my journey in Christ. By sharing, I hope to be able to help those who have struggled through the same things I have in life. As someone who suffered through severe depression for a good chunk of my life, I want to be able to reach others who might be going through these same types of tough times. I want to show people how real Christ is, and how through him, we have overcome the world!

Jesus didn’t say it would be easy, but he promised that getting through it would be worth it. He didn’t leave us here defenseless either; he left us with his authority ([Luke 10:19](<>)). He gave us all that we need to live a godly life ([2 Peter 1:3](<>)). However, you must know what these things are and how to use them. We have the armor of Christ, the fruits of the spirit, the Holy Spirit, the sword of the spirit, and most importantly, we have prayer; and all that is just the tip of the iceberg!

I hope you put these things into practice and watch how Christ improves your life. Stick around, explore, and let’s grow our relationship with Christ together.
