title: About Me

Overcome with Christ strives to help individuals know who they are in Christ so they can know that they have power in their circumstances. Thus, we build hope for tomorrow.
Because Jesus overcame, we also have overcome. Life isnâ€™t always going to be easy, but we have hope for the future in Christ. We may not already feel strong, but Christ empowers us now.
Jesus is that light at the end of the tunnel that brought me hope when everything around me felt pointless. Because of my childhood experiences, it is my mission to learn to appreciate the joys of this world in Christ, and also help others do so.
