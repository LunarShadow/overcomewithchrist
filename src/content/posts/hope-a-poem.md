summary: Hope can be such a dangerous feeling. But if placed in the right thing, it can be very rewarding. Here is a poem that I wrote; enjoy.

<blockquote>
<p>Who against hope believed in hope...</p>
<cite>Romans 4:18</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>I see you</p>
<p>Yes, I see you.</p>
<p>I see how you're crying out for help</p>
<p>With that smile on your face as you pass by,</p>
<p>But the eye contact is hard to supply</p>
<p>Because you know if they see you inside</p>
<p>They might get caught in your raging sea</p>
<p>And if they sink, then well, that makes two of you.</p>
<p>If they can't help then what is there left to do?</p>
<p>Hope, hope, hope...</p>
<p>it seems too dangerous to hope.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's actually too comfortable</p>
<p>To think that perchance you could actually be stable.</p>
<p>Maybe the sea won't calm down</p>
<p>Maybe the storm is here to stay</p>
<p>Maybe chaos is all there is.</p>
<p>So you think it's better to not hold on to anything that could make you sink.</p>
<p>But have you considered holding on to what could make you float?</p>
<p>Not just for a moment, but for eternity;</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, the one true God.</p>
