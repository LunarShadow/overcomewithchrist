summary: There will come a time when you will feel like you are alone in your belief. But you're not the only one who's felt that way.

<p>“Yet I will preserve 7,000 others in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed him!””</p>
<cite>1 Kings 19:18 NLT</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>As a Christian there will come a time when you will feel like you are alone in your belief. Like the whole world is against you or just doesn't get it. But you are not alone, not just because you have the Holy Spirit, but because there are others who also have that same spirit.</p>

<p>Remember Samuel when he fled from Jezebel and complained to God about how he was the only prophet left that still stood for God. Just for God to tell him that there are seven thousand other people who haven't yet bowed for Jezebel.</p>

<p>Sometimes it might feel like we are the only ones walking the narrow road, but I'm here to tell you, you are not alone! Keep going, keep standing firm, and know that others are fighting alongside with you.</p>

<p>Have any testimonies to share on this? Let's encourage each other in the comments.</p>
