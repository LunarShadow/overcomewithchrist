<blockquote>
<p>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone</p>
<cite>James 2:17</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>You've read before in <a>James 2:17</a> that faith without works is dead. I want to take a moment and challenge your understanding of this verse.</p>

<p>When you believe or have faith in something, you usually act according to that faith. If you have faith that a chair will hold your weight, then you sit on that chair without a second thought. If you believe that your God shall supply all your needs according to His riches and glory in Jesus Christ (<a>Philippians 4:19</a>), then you should act accordingly. If you have faith that your God is more powerful than anything in this universe and if He is for you, then no one can be against you (<a>Romans 8:31</a>), then why do you worry about your enemies and situations? If you have faith that by seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, all these things will be added onto you (<a>Matthew 6:33</a>), then why are you worried about food, clothes, or all the things that unbelievers worry about? If you believe you have the victory then why are you talking defeat? Act and speak accordingly because faith without works is dead!</p>

<p>So then what about the commandments that Jesus has given us? Well, we don't do those works because of faith, but out of love. Jesus said the one who loves him, does as he has commanded (<a>John 14:15</a>). Therefore, we love God, love our neighbors, and walk in righteousness because we love him (<a>1 John 4:19</a>). Let's not confuse actions done for love with works resulting from faith.</p>
