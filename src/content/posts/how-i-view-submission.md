summary: From my experience, when people think of being submissive they always
  think of giving up all control to someone. And by giving up all control they
  have thereby lost their own freedom. Just because you're submissive, doesn't
  mean you lose your freedom, depending on the circumstances of which you have
  to submit.

<blockquote>
<p>You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are right, because that’s what I am. And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other’s feet. I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.</p>

<p>From my experience, when people think of being submissive they always think of giving up all control to someone. And by giving up all control they have thereby lost their own freedom. Just because you're submissive, doesn't mean you lose your freedom, depending on the circumstances of which you have to submit.</p>

<p>When it comes to being submissive in a marriage, it shouldn't mean losing all freedom. This isn't an opportunity for the husband to say: "I'm the head, so you must do everything I say!" and be tyrannical. <a>Ephesians 5:25-28</a> says: "For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God’s word. He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault. In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself".</p>

<p>So a husband should love himself enough to be able to love his wife as Christ loved the church. How did Christ love the church? The answer lies in <a>John 3:16</a>. Jesus was willing to sacrifice himself for the church, thus a husband should also be willing to sacrifice himself for his wife. And just as the church is submissive to Christ because of his sacrifice, the wife also should be submissive to her husband as it states in <a>Ephesians 5:22-24</a>. the wife should also be able to respect and trust that her husband has the family's best interest at heart.</p>

<p>Outside of marriage we are also to submit not just to God but also to worldly authority. Because of this, sometimes we will experience some hardship but we know that God is watching and will reward us for doing what is right even when in an unpleasant situation (<a>1 Peter 2:19-21</a>). It's also important to keep in mind however that we serve God first and foremost. When submitting to worldly authority we are doing it because it pleases God, not because it pleases man. Thus, anything God tells us during the circumstances supersedes any contradictory orders from worldly authorities.</p>

<p>Having said all this, I still find it challenging for me to submit to a certain authority, even when what they tell me to do doesn't negatively impact my faith. Sometimes my pride takes the better of me, After reading <a>1 Peter 2:13-14</a> and <a>Ephesians 5:21</a> I will be trying to do better. Being meek does not mean that I am weak, and I trust that God will provide grace where it is needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... So Jesus got them together to settle things down. He said, “You’ve observed how godless rulers throw their weight around, how quickly a little power goes to their heads. It’s not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant. Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. That is what the Son of Man has done: He came to serve, not be served—and then to give away his life in exchange for the many who are held hostage.”</p>
<cite>Matthew 20:24-28 MSG</cite>
