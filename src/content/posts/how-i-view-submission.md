summary: From my experience, when people think of being submissive they always
  think of giving up all control to someone. And by giving up all control they
  have thereby lost their own freedom. Just because you're submissive, doesn't
  mean you lose your freedom, depending on the circumstances of which you have
  to submit.

<p>You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are right, because that’s what I am.  And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other’s feet.  I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.</p>

<p>From my experience, when people think of being submissive they always think of giving up all control to someone. And by giving up all control they have thereby lost their own freedom. Just because you're submissive, doesn't mean you lose your freedom, depending on the circumstances of which you have to submit.</p>

<p>When it comes to being submissive in a marriage, it shouldn't mean losing all freedom. This isn't an opportunity for the husband to say: "I'm the head, so you must do everything I say!" and be tyrannical. Ephesians 5:25-28 says: "For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God’s word.  He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault. In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself".</p>

<p>So a husband should love himself enough to be able to love his wife as Christ loved the church. How did Christ love the church? The answer lies in <span class="tooltips">John 3:16 <span class="tooltip-text">For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.</span></span>. Jesus was willing to sacrifice himself for the church, thus a husband should also be willing to sacrifice himself for his wife. And just as the church is submissive to Christ because of his sacrifice, the wife also should be submissive to her husband as it states in <span class="tooltips">Ephesians 5:22-24 <span class="tooltip-text">For wives, this means submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of his body, the church. As the church submits to Christ, so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything.</span></span>. the wife should also be able to respect and trust that her husband has the family's best interest at heart.</p>

<p>Outside of marriage we are also to submit not just to God but also to worldly authority. Because of this, sometimes we will experience some hardship but we know that God is watching and will reward us for doing what is right even when in an unpleasant situation ( <span class="tooltips">1 Peter 2:19-21 <span class="tooltip-text">For God is pleased when, conscious of his will, you patiently endure unjust treatment. Of course, you get no credit for being patient if you are beaten for doing wrong. But if you suffer for doing good and endure it patiently, God is pleased with you. For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered for you. He is your example, and you must follow in his steps. </span></span>). It's also important to keep in mind however that we serve God first and foremost. When submitting to worldly authority we are doing it because it pleases God, not because it pleases man. Thus, anything God tells us during the circumstances supersedes any contradictory orders from worldly authorities.</p>

<p>Having said all this, I still find it challenging for me to submit to a certain authority, even when what they tell me to do doesn't negatively impact my faith. Sometimes my pride takes the better of me, After reading <span class="tooltips">1 Peter 2:13-14 <span class="tooltip-text">For the Lord’s sake, submit to all human authority—whether the king as head of state, or the officials he has appointed. For the king has sent them to punish those who do wrong and to honor those who do right.</span></span> and <span class="tooltips">Ephesians 5:21 <span class="tooltip-text">And further, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</span></span> I will be trying to do better. Being meek does not mean that I am weak, and I trust that God will provide grace where it is needed.</p>

<p>... So Jesus got them together to settle things down. He said, “You’ve observed how godless rulers throw their weight around, how quickly a little power goes to their heads. It’s not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant. Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. That is what the Son of Man has done: He came to serve, not be served—and then to give away his life in exchange for the many who are held hostage.”</p>
