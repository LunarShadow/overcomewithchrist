<blockquote>
<p>The Son is the dazzling radiance of God’s splendor, the exact expression of God’s true nature—his mirror image! He holds the universe together and expands it by the mighty power of his spoken word...</p>
<cite>Hebrews 1:3 TPT</cite>
</blockquote>

<h5>It was created by God</h5>
<p><a>Genesis 1:1-2</a> explains to us that in the beginning, before we had any concept of time, God created the heavens and the earth. This means that God is greater than the universe. If the universe is a huge and ever-expanding entity, and God created it, how much bigger is God than the universe? </p>

<h5>It's only a location</h5>
<p>The heavens isn't a being, and neither does it have intelligence. It only has laws and principles set by God Almighty. Including orbital patterns, gravity, separation of land and water, etc. So it can't grant or take away anything from you, or for you. Neither can it hear prayers and answer them. Actually, the heavens also praise God (<a>Psalm 148:3-5</a>).</p>

<p>In fact, God instructs that we do not look towards the cosmos and start worshiping it (<a>Deuteronomy 4:19</a>). How can we leave the creator to go worship his creation (<a>Isaiah 47:13</a>)? Don't you know by worshiping the creator, you also glorify His creation?</p>

<h5>It will be replaced</h5>
<p>On the day of judgment, there will be no room for this current earth and its surrounding heavens: its atmosphere and the current universe (<a>Revelation 20:11</a>). This universe and earth will disappear, and a new universe and earth will be brought down by the Lord almighty (<a>2 Peter 3:13</a>, <a>Revelation 21:1-2</a>). So, if you're looking to the universe for guidance, help, or counsel, know that you are relying on something that will pass away. Besides, there is something greater than the universe: Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
