Something I’ve been learning recently is to not run away from your problems. Least while you’re running from it, you run right into another problem and the previous one catches up with you.

It’s better for you to go through the process required to solve the situation you’re going through (with the Holy Spirit) than to try to escape your situation.

Sometimes the process may feel difficult, but in that process, you will experience growth. You will learn to rely on the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. You will make your future easier to deal with, and you will cut off things from going down generations.

Jesus is a God of process. He himself made sure to go through every process that was required of him. From waiting to start His ministry until after he got baptized by John, to the 40 days in the wilderness, to the crucification.

Salvation is instant, but growth takes time. Healing is instant, but deliverance is a process. The act of renewing your mind takes time because there are many truths that your heart still needs to be exposed to.

I thank God for taking me through this rough patch I was experiencing because through the process I learned so much, and I realize that I’ve grown a lot during it all.

So I want to encourage you today, if you are experiencing a problem that seem impossible, cast your worries on the Lord, and be patient in the Lord. You will come out victorious, and your foundation will be that much more firm.
