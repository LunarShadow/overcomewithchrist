Lord You are good and Your mercies endures forever.

You are the almighty, the great I AM

You are the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end

Who is there like You oh Lord in all the Earth?

You conquered the giants and split the seas, You stopped the sun in its tracks and defeated nations.

I worship You God of heavens armies.

All honor and glory and power and strength onto You for You are worthy.

You are the creator of the Heavens and the Earth.

You are all-powerful, all-knowing, and a very present help in time of need.

There are not enough words to speak of Your glory. A lifetime is not enough to give you praise. You are the holy of holies.

You hold the whole Earth in the palm of your hands!

Who can be against you oh Lord? Who can defy your decrees?

You speak and it becomes so, Your word brings life.

I give you all the glory, the honor, and the praise.

Thank you, in Jesus's name.

Amen
