<p>
Lord You are good and Your mercies endures forever.
</p>
<p>
You are the almighty, the great I AM
</p>
<p>
You are the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end
</p>
<p>
Who is there like You oh Lord in all the Earth?
</p>
<p>
You conquered the giants and split the seas, You stopped the sun in its tracks and defeated nations.
</p>
<p>
I worship You God of heavens armies.
</p>
<p>
All honor and glory and power and strength onto You for You are worthy.
</p>
<p>
You are the creator of the Heavens and the Earth.
</p>
<p>
You are all-powerful, all-knowing, and a very present help in time of need.
</p>
<p>
There are not enough words to speak of Your glory. A lifetime is not enough to give you praise. You are the holy of holies.
</p>
<p>
You hold the whole Earth in the palm of your hands!
</p>
<p>
Who can be against you oh Lord? Who can defy your decrees?
</p>
<p>
You speak and it becomes so, Your word brings life.
</p>
<p>
I give you all the glory, the honor, and the praise.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, in Jesus's name.
</p>
<p>
Amen
