Some of the things I might say here may sound extreme, but I’m okay with that. In this lukewarm world, people who know what they want always seem extreme.
Today I am going to discuss 10 things I learned in my almost 3 decades of being alive. My birthday just passed and I’m only a couple of years from being 30, So I decided not was a good time to impart some wisdom to y’all and also reflect on some lessons learned, most of them the hard way.
Jumping right into it:

<ol class="blog-list">

<li><b>There’s no point being fake, just be yourself</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
<li>There’s only one of you, so learn who you are and be that</li>
<li>It’s okay to standout sometimes, being different isn’t always bad</li>
<li>It’s easier to build on something genuine than to continue to figure out something fake </li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>Your friend circle is crucial</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
<li>Have friends that are genuine and that you can be genuine with</li>
<li>Have friends that keep you accountable</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>The world doesn’t revolve around you</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
   <li>It revolves around Christ</li>
   <li>Let your pride be in the Lord</li>
   <li>Life moves on</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>Don’t do business with unstable people</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
   <li>Either you do them a solid, or you say no</li>
   <li>Don’t mingle business relationships with friendships when the person has shown themselves to not be professional</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>You don’t have to feel guilty</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
   <li>Guilt is different from remorse</li>
   <li>God doesn’t make people feel guilty, the devil does</li>
   <li> Don’t do anything for people because you feel guilty, do it because you want to help and are able to help</li>
   <li>You’re not the only person who can help someone, so don’t feel pressured to help everyone</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>Emotional Intelligence is important</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
  <li>Otherwise people will be too quick to manipulate you</li>
  <li>You’ll have a hard time keeping any kind of relationship if you’re not able to assess your emotions properly</li>
  <li> Accept that emotions can sometimes be unreasonable, but necessary. They should be guiding factors but not decision-makers.</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>It’s okay to lose friends</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
    <li>Not everyone that you are or were close to needs to continue to be in your life</li>
    <li>Some friendships are useful only for a season</li>
    <li>The Holy Spirit is a better friend than any person could be</li></ul>
 </li>

<li><b>It’s okay to have standards and set boundaries</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
    <li> You respect yourself more when you can stand up for what you believe in.</li>
    <li>People also respect you more when they know you have respect for yourself</li>
   <li>People don’t need to understand the reason behind your boundaries, they just need to understand where you draw the line</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b>Dating for fun is a waste of time</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
    <li>I don’t know why people enjoy heartbreak so much.</li>
    <li> Dating intentionally makes it easier to know when it’s time to move on.</li>
    <li>If you don’t know what you want, you could end up with what you don’t want.</li>
    <li> Giving someone a chance doesn’t have to result in dating. People can prove themselves in friendship</li></ul>
</li>

<li><b> You’re not responsible for people’s actions</b>
<ul class="blog-list">
    <li>Ultimately people make their own choices</li>
    <li>You don’t have to be extra anything to get people to do xyz.</li>
    <li>People will show you who they are if you just watch.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
