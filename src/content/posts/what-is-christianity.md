Being a Christian is more than just going to church. It's a lifestyle, understanding, and spiritual renewal and development. Don't understand what I mean? Continue reading for more details.
</p>

<h5>1. Lifestyle</h5>
<p>
Being a Christian is a lifestyle. It's not something that you leave at church or the doorstep when you go out. It's something you do every day. The same way you wake up, breathe, and move is the same way you are a Christian. Everything you do should glorify Christ (<a>1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). The words you speak should reflect your heavenly father (<a>2 Timothy 2:16</a>). The decisions you make should have Christ and his kingdom in mind. The Holy Spirit should be more than just an experience, but also a counsel.
</p>

<h5>2. Understanding</h5>
<p>
Being a Christian is an understanding (<a>Ephesians 1:18-19</a>). You should know that Christ is who the Bible says He is. You should understand that He is the God of the living and not of the dead (<a>Matthew 22:32</a>). As you build your understanding of Christ, you build your understanding of who you are. When you understand that nothing is impossible to God and that he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world, the way you go about things changes. Faith is a stepping stone to understanding. If you have faith, then you are on your way to building your understanding.
</p>

<h5>3. Spiritual renewal and development</h5>
<p>
Being a Christian is a renewal and development of your spirit. When you got born again, a new spirit was given to you (<a>2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, <a>Ezekiel 36:26</a>). This new spirit will now need to be developed. Spiritual development comes through reading the Bible and knowing the character of God. It also comes through meditation and spending time in prayer with the Holy Spirit. Putting your faith into practice is how you show spiritual growth which causes things to change in your life (<a>James 1:22-25</a>).
</p>

<p>
Do not take what you have been given for granted. Your life should change once you are born again. It could change slowly or suddenly, but either way, there will be a change. Yield to the Holy Spirit because He now dwells in you. You are the temple of God so keep your temple holy (<a>1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). Know also that you still have free will, so choose to do godly things and not worldly things.
