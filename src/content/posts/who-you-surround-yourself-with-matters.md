<p>Keep company with the wise and you will become wise. If you make friends with stupid people, you will be ruined.</p>
<cite>Proverbs 13:20 (GNT)</cite></blockquote>

<p>
Your friend group is very important no matter who you are. They usually end up dictating the types of habits you build. The more you interact with them, the more you will start to reflect them in some way.
</p>

<p>
If you are surrounded by people who are toxic, you will find yourself developing toxic habits. Especially during moments when you're not feeling strong, or are at your best; moments where you need a mental break or emotional support which you may not be able to find. If you surround yourself with people with good character, you will find that you will also develop good character. During your moments of weakness, you will be empowered to do better, because you have good examples to follow.

<blockquote>
<p>As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.</p>
<cite>Proverbs 27:17 (NLT)</cite></blockquote>

<p>
Having said that, who you are is who you will tend to attract, whether or not that's who you want to be. By this I mean, if you are more likely to be lazy, then you will find yourself around more people who are lazy. Even though you wish to be a hard worker, surrounding yourself with hard workers might feel threatening; especially if you're not ready to put in the work. So, work to be the person who you want to be, and you will see that the people who you start to attract will reflect that; expressly when mixed with prayer.

Throughout different seasons of my life, I have noticed that my friend group always matched and helped solidify who I was. While in school, I tended to befriend people who were like-minded and bore similar characteristics to me. Each of my friends held at least one characteristic that resembled me. Whether it was wanting to do well in school, or having some self-destructive tendencies.
</p>

<p>
I praise God I was able to find a church full of admirable people on my first try. This meant that as I developed new relationships in college, I was mainly surrounded by Christ-loving, God-fearing, authentic people. These qualities were really something I could look up to, and things that I really wanted to pick up on. I thank God for them often. I also thank God that he always took me out of toxic relationships even if I didn't really want to part from them. While it stung at first, it really helped me to grow, especially when I learned to not cling to these relationships.

<p>Wounds from a sincere friend are better than many kisses from an enemy.</p>
<cite>Proverbs 27:6 (NLT)</cite></blockquote>

<p>
All this to say, it's okay if God takes you out of certain relationships that meant a lot to you. He does it for your and their benefit. His plans for us are good, even when it hurts. When you start to change for Christ, the people you find yourself wanting to be around will also change. Additionally, the people who want to be around you will also change. It's bittersweet sometimes but if you let go and let God, you'll find yourself surrounded by amazing individuals who will help instill Christ-like values into your life. Pray that God brings you to these people, and open yourself to making new relationships, and closing others. It's not the end of the world, it's the beginning of your story of glory.
