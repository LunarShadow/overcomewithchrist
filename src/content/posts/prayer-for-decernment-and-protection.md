<p>Lord,</p>

<p>In this time of uncertainty I pray for discernment. May your truth be revealed to me. May your truth be revealed to your sheep, and to all who seek the truth. I praise you God because even during these difficult times you are in control! You are opening blind eyes, and you are softening hardened hearts.</p>

<p>Your word declares that no weapon formed against me shall prosper! The Spirit of the living God dwells in me, of whom shall I be afraid? Lord, I dwell in your secret place, and I find rest in your shadow! I cast my worries unto you, my rock, and my foundation, the source of my strength! You've promised that your word will never return to you void oh God! I thank you for your protection.</p>

<p>Holy spirit, I thank you for your guidance, I thank you for your comfort, and I thank you for leading me in paths of righteousness! I thank you for with you my cup overflows with blessings, and with grace. Your mercy is never-ending, they are new every morning!</p>

<p>I give you all the honor, all the glory, and all the praise. In Jesus' Name, Amen!</p>
