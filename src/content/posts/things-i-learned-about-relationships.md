The topic of marriage has always been a controversial topic for me. I’ve never really understood why many people feel like they are incomplete if they don’t get married.

In pursuit of answers, I’ve asked a lot of my friends about it, I’ve observed different dynamics in marriages, and I’ve tried to see what the Bible says about marriage. 

In my rebelliousness towards marriage, I would alway stick to and meditate on Paul’s recommendation to not get married, or get married to sooth “burning passion” as he calls it. Or even Jesus’ own words about how some people choose to or are born to be eunuchs, and how there’s no marriage in heaven. 

But recently, after meditating on the topic and with a little more openness to the concept of marriage, I’ve learned that there is a purpose in marriage. While everyone can create their purpose, God has also given us a purpose for marriage. 

After speaking with my Pastor and many of the leaders that I consider mentors, I’ve come to see that the purpose of marriage is not just to please ourselves but to increase the kingdom of God. Whether that’s through doing ministry together, or in creating a godly seed. 

When God is truly in a marriage, the marriage will bring him glory, and will expand his kingdom. I’ve seen that the marriages where both couples are on one accord spiritually manage to overcome a lot more adversaries smoothly. 

Upon meditating on these things further I’ve come to realize that dating is still annoying and borderline unnecessary; standards are important and so is faith in God that he will direct you to the right person; boundaries are very important and don’t have to make sense to others; and it’s a good thing to want to have a family because having a godly family is also a way to bring glory to God. 

I’m always so grateful to have the Holy Spirit and a teachable heart and mind. I’ve grown so much by listening to him, and meditating on the word of God. Many things in this world don’t make sense, but I’m forever grateful to the Holy Spirit who sheds light on all my thoughts and doubts no matter how simple or complex.
