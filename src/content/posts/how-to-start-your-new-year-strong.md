As the year comes to an end, everyone starts to write goals and create ideas about how the next year will be. Whether or not a year will be your year or just another year all depends on your mindset. When you keep yourself aligned with God's plan and purpose, every year is your year!
<h2>1. Fast</h2>
Fasting is an important spiritual activity. Decide on a fasting time and what you want in the coming year. Set aside time to read and study your Bible. Also, listen to messages or a single message on repeat as you are fasting; this will help align your mindset as you continue to the next steps.
<h2>2. Pray</h2>
While fasting, make sure you are also praying and asking the Lord for guidance. What does he have planned for you in the year to come? Which directions should you take? Which goals should you set? Where do you need to improve? What is the Lord's will for the world and how do you fit in it? Find out, and prepare yourself for the battles and victories that are coming.
<h2>3. Prophesy</h2>
As you pray, declare God's word into your life. Speak into your year. Declare all that you want to see. This helps shape your mindset on how the year should go. Speak that which the Spirit lays on your heart with power and conviction, then write it down for reference throughout the year. Be diligent in bringing these to your consciousness regularly throughout the year, so you know why you are doing what you are doing.

Every year has a purpose, especially as we draw closer to the Lord's return. Always do everything you can to match your will with God's will. When you do this, you will find Grace will be working in your life as you will not be frustrating the workings of the Spirit.
