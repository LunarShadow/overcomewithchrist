Hey guys, 

I some times write poems and spoken word and I decided to share one of them with you guys. I have the YouTube version linked in case you prefer to hear it instead of read it. 

This one is titled “Am I required to dream”. Let me know what you think about it by sending me an email at contact@overcomewithchrist.com.

Thanks and enjoy!

<strong>Am I required to dream?</strong>

Must I have plans full of grandeur of who or what I want to become? Do my dreams have to include crowds or waves of people I may never truly get to know or understand? Superficial smiles and laughs filled with emptiness because we can’t speak of the hollowness we have inside?

To busy for the now because I need to prepare for the next this, and the up coming that. No space in between to breath, can barely remember to swallow in anticipation for a never ending tomorrow. A willing slave to the system that constantly reminds me to forget to be alive.

<strong>Am I required to dream?</strong>

Am I obligated to run after love? Whether it’s to love or be loved. To chase after an over glorified feeling that most can’t even put into word. To one it’s everything, to the other it’s nothing. Maybe it’s sunflowers in an open grass field, or that feeling of falling from an impossible height that has you crying in regret soon after.

Love is love they say, without even truly understanding what it is. Is it blind or all seeing? Is it a response or unconditional? Is it entertainment or affection? Whether an unconditionally blind entertaining affection, or an all seeing response to affectionate entertainment, why look to it to define your value? Is your value in how much love you receive or in how much love you can give?

<strong>Am I required to dream?</strong>

Whether the sky is the limit or I should shoot for the stars. Whether it’s a night dream or a day dream. Whether it’s to leave my mark, or acquire my mark. Whether it’s to start this or finish that. Am I required to run after fleeting promises of a better tomorrow?

<strong>Am I required to dream?</strong>

They tell me I don’t want to have regrets. They say I only live once. They say to make the best of everything. If I only have one try, how do I know what is best?

<strong>Am I required to dream?</strong>

I feel it’s better to leave my dreams in the hands of the Lord. Store up your treasures in heaven says He. I know your yesterday, I know your tomorrow. I will lead you and guide you into all righteousness if you would let me. Don’t dwell in sorrow, or doubt, or anxiousness. I know the end from the beginning, so let me worry about your tomorrow. I will never leave you nor forsake you, so allow me to display you as the centerpiece of my masterpiece.
