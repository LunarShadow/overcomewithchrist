<blockquote>
<p>"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him…"</p>
<cite>Job 13:15 KJV</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes we think we make a better god than the Almighty Himself. It is so easy to question his form of justice when it does not align with what the world has thought us to be justice. We also claim that He isn't fair or right when things don't go our way. When we do this, we are usually just whining, and not reflecting on who God is.</p>

<p>It's not God who is to conform to our idea of justice, love, sovereignty, mercy, etc. but, we that have to conform to His will (<a>Romans 12:2-3</a>). Our will and God's will do not align because God makes adjustments but because we make adjustments.</p>

<p>If God adjusts his will based on every individual, he would be a confused and directionless God. Since he would be different depending on who he is dealing with, but the Bible says in <a>Hebrews 13:8</a>, "He is the same yesterday, today and forever".</p>

<p>Additionally, <a>Acts 10:34</a> also states "Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons…", meaning he doesn't show favoritism. It's not because of your status that God is supposed to incline his ear more towards you. That also means that regardless of who you are God is ready to listen to you.</p>

<p>Above all, God is God and it's up to you to get on his level. Thanks to Jesus and the Holy Spirit, that's a lot easier to do than one might think. If you take the time to humble yourself, stop whining, reach out to Him, and listen you will find that you have some adjustments to make, and those adjustments are all within your power to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"… He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. But even if he doesn’t, … we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”</p>
<cite>Daniel 3:17-18 NLT</cite>
