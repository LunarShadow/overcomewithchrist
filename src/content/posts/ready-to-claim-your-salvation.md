<p>If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.” Jew and Gentile are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him. For “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</p>

Father God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ; the son of the living God. I believe God raised him from the dead and He is alive today. I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day. Through my faith in His name; the name of Jesus I receive remission of sins for my soul. I receive eternal life into my heart. Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul. Thank you for giving me a new life. I am born again, I am a child of God now. Thank you Lord. Amen!
