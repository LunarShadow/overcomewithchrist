As we celebrate the birth of Chris, be reminded that Jesus, God himself, didn’t die on the cross 33 years later in vain. He not only died to take away the sins of the world, but to give all those who believe in Him eternal life. 

This eternal life is not something to receive later, but something we receive the minute we get born again. 1 Peter 1:23 NKJV reads ”having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever,“. 

So, as you celebrate the birth of the Christ this year, be mindful and thank him for all He has done for the world. And if you are not yet born again and want to know how to get born again, find out more in the [Ready to Claim Your Salvation ](https://overcomewithchrist.com/posts/ready-to-claim-your-salvation)post.

Have a Merry Christmas!
