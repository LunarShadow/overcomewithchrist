<p>As Christians, it’s important that we share the word with others. It’s not just about sharing the word, but more importantly, getting people to give their life to Christ. Just in case you’re wondering why this is important, I have listed 3 reasons below.</p>

<h5>1. Jesus sent us on this mission</h5>

<p>In <a>Mark 16:15-16</a> and <a>Matthew 28:19-20</a> Jesus says to the disciples “go and make disciples of all the nations”. Going out and preaching the word to the world is the one mandate that Jesus has given all who follow him. Which lines up with loving your neighbor as yourself; since loving your neighbor also means not wanting them to stay in spiritual death nor be part of the second death. You can learn more about why salvation is needed in my previous post: <a href="https://overcomewithchrist.com/posts/why-we-need-salvation/">Why we need salvation</a>.</p>

<h5>2. God wants everyone to know the truth</h5>

<p>In <a>John 15:22</a> Jesus explained to his disciples that it wouldn’t be fair for people to be judged if they didn’t get the chance to hear him speak. Thus, when we share the Gospel with people, we are giving them the opportunity to make their choice. God’s judgment then just becomes an affirmation of their choice. This also takes the responsibility off you since your part is done (<a>Ezekiel 33:7-9</a>, <a>Acts 18:6</a>).</p>

<p>In <a>1 Timothy 2:4-5</a>, Paul also lets us know that it is God’s will for everyone to be saved and know the truth. And the truth is that there is only one mediator who can reconcile God and humanity – the man Christ Jesus. Being a good person doesn’t give you spiritual life, being born again through Jesus does. Part of preaching the Gospel is just letting people know this simple truth. Some people will reject it, but Jesus already knows that.</p>

<h5>3. It will lead the way to Jesus’ return</h5>

<p><a>Matthew 24:14</a> lets us know that the end will come when the Gospel is heard by all nations. If you’re like me, and you’re ready for Jesus to come back already, then preach the Word! We have this responsibility, and when Jesus does come back, I want to be able to show that I did my best to bring his sheep back to him.</p>

<p>There are some things that are sometimes easier said than done and depending on your personality type, this could be one of them. Look out for a future post on how to make sharing the gospel a little easier. Hopefully, that will give you some good tips to help you put this into practice.</p>
