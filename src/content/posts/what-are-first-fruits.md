<blockquote><p>Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing and your vats will brim over with new wine.</p>
<cite> Proverbs 3:9-10 </cite></blockquote>

<p>
In <a>Leviticus 23:9-10</a>, God tells Moses to inform the people that they should bring him the first crops of their first harvest season in the promised land. In their obedience, they would remember that they were in the land that the Lord promised them.

Giving our first fruits is a way to honor and thank the Lord for all the provisions we received in the seasons past. It’s different from tithes in that it is not 10% of our income, and it only needs to be done annually; and it can also be done when God blesses us with a new job or business venture.

How much you give depends on how much you want to honor God with. It could be your first yearly paycheck, your first month's worth of income, your first paycheck from your new source of income, or any other amount you care to honor the Lord with. However, before deciding how much to give, I would strongly advise praying about it first; and when you give, be sure to give freely and not grudgingly.

<h5>Why give first fruits?</h5>
<p>
<ul class="blog-list">
 	<li>Giving our first fruits means giving our best to God.</li>
 	<li>Giving our first fruits opens us up to the working of God in our lives.</li>
 	<li>Giving our first fruits shows where our priorities lie.</li>
 	<li>Giving our first fruits shows our obedience.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When giving, whether in tithes, seeds, offerings, etc., don’t think about it as giving to the physical church, but as giving to the Lord. Your giving first and foremost shows your obedience and reverence for God. Your giving will be used for the expansion of the Kingdom of God. Remember, it all belongs to God (and you by inheritance).

This year I gave my first month's income as my first fruit sacrifice. It was tough because I kept thinking about all that I am saving towards. But then I had to remind myself that the Lord is my provider! I lack in nothing, neither do I want in anything because the Lord is my shepherd! I only have to stay obedient. As Psalm 91:1 says “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high, shall abide in the shadow of the almighty”. Therefore I declare: I abide in the shadow of the almighty!

I challenge you to give your first month's worth of income and see how your year pans out! Let me know in the comments if you accepted the challenge.
