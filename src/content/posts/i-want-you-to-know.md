<p>
That Jesus loves you. I'm not talking about a superficial love either. While you were yet in your mother's womb, the Lord knew you and loved you (<a>Jeremiah 1:5</a>). He's counted the hairs on your head (<a>Luke 12:7</a>), and he has great plans for you. Plans to prosper you, and give you a hope and a future (<a>Jeremiah 29:11</a>). If you didn't know this, then I want you to know this. I want you to take it in. I want you to understand this.
</p>

<p>
Before you could do anything to prove yourself (<a>Romans 5:8</a>), God said you were enough. He showed this by sending his son, in human flesh, who did nothing wrong, to be sin for you and make you righteous (<a>2 Corinth 5:21</a>). He gave you an advocate who will stand for you when you mess up (<a>1 John 2:1</a>), and a comforter to walk with you and guide you in every situation so you may have peace (<a>John 14:26-27</a>).
</p>

<p>
All he asks in return is that you acknowledge Him and confess that He is your Lord and savior (<a>Romans 10:9</a>). Because His mercy is what saves you and all you need to complete it is faith (<a>Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). And once you understand that God's love is already the highest it can be and can't be lessened or increased by what you do, then you will be set free (<a>Ephesians 3:18-19</a>).
</p>

<p>
Once you realize this, I hope you'll be willing to give your life back to God, the creator of all the heavens and the earth (<a>Isaiah 40:28-31</a>).
