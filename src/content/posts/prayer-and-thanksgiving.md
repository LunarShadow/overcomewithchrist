<p>Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus. And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from meâ€”everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you.</p>

Thanksgiving is also an important part of prayer. And after you've prayed, don't let discouraging thoughts dominate your mind, but instead think on what is true. Think on what God's word says about the situation. Think of who God is, and all he had done. Thank him, and have faith and know that all good and wonderful things come from God (<a>James 1:17</a>).

The devil, our adversary, comes to steal, kill, and destroy (<a>John 10:10</a>). But through Jesus we have power over them. We have been given authority and can cast them out (<a>Mark 16:17</a>).

<p>
And we also know that if we ask the father for anything, through Jesus, he will give to us (<a>John 16:23</a>). And also <a>Mark 11:24</a> says I tell you, you can pray for anything, and if you believe that you've received it, it will be yours.
