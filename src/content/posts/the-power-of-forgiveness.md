> Make allowance for each other’s faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.” ‭‭\
> <cite> Colossians‬ ‭3‬:‭13‬ ‭NLT‬‬</cite>

You probably already know that forgiving others is more for yourself than for the other person. Holding grudges and being bitter only deteriorates you. Half the time the other person might not even know that they did you wrong, or think that they need to apologize. So, to keep yourself from being bitter you forgive the other person.

Did you know, the same forgiveness you need to give to others, you should also extend to yourself? The same way you don’t want to be bitter towards others, you shouldn’t be bitter towards yourself. Maybe the reason you can’t forgive others is because you never learned to forgive yourself.

Recently I went through a lot of emotional ups and down with an individual. It took a lot for me to forgive them. But then I found that even though I told myself I forgive them, I still felt bitter about the whole situation. But the bitterness was pointed at myself. The situation was difficult because I couldn’t forgive myself for my own guilt.

I realized this after attending a leaders conference, and on the last day of that conference, I accepted the mercy of Christ, and forgave myself for all that I felt I did wrong concerning the situation I was bitter about. After I forgave myself, I found that I no longer was holding on to something that should have been dead already, and I was no longer holding myself back from being able to serve Christ fully again.

It’s good to extend to others the same mercy you extend to yourself. But if you find you’re harder on yourself than you are to others, then extend the same grace you do to others to yourself. You’re not greater than God the Father that you should harbor unforgiveness towards anybody, yourself included. Especially since He gave his only Son for you that you may enter into his eternal mercy.

So, if you’re harboring any unforgiveness right now, I challenge you to let go of it and break free from those shackles.

> Lay aside bitter words, temper tantrums, revenge, profanity, and insults. But instead be kind and affectionate toward one another. Has God graciously forgiven you? Then graciously forgive one another in the depths of Christ’s love.” ‭‭
