<p>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. But even if he doesn’t, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”</p>
<cite>Daniel 3:16—18</cite></blockquote>

<p>Who is the God that you serve? Is He your genie that you call on only when you need something? Or is He the all-powerful, almighty, creator of all the universe? Sometimes we think that being blessed or favored only happens when we get exactly what we want, or only when things that we see as good happen to us.</p>

<p>Whether we are going through the valleys, or standing on the mountains, God is God. He loves us, He’s with us, and He’s in control. Just because our current conditions aren’t exceptional doesn’t mean that God doesn’t care. It doesn’t mean that He’s left us, or that He doesn’t know what’s going on. God always know what’s going on, and He’s always in control.</p>

<p>Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego said in Daniel 3:18 "even if he doesn’t”. Even if God doesn’t rescue me from the fiery furnace, I will still worship him. Even when the going gets tough, I will still praise God. I don’t think a lot of people can say that.</p>

<p>I know that most times I tend to doubt God when I’ve prayed and prayed, and my situation doesn’t change, or I doubt my faith and my salvation. But that shouldn’t be the case, because I should have assurance that no matter what happens, God is still sovereign, I’m still covered, and the outcome is still for my good. I might be going through hardship now, but eternity will be nothing compared to this short time.</p>
