<blockquote>
“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.” ‭‭
<cite>Romans‬ ‭8‬:‭28‬-‭30‬ ‭KJV‬‬</cite></blockquote>

Gods blessing and calling don’t warrant immediate comfort. If anything, the devil is more likely to promise us comfort, because he knows that in our comfort we become complacent. 

Abraham was called to be a nomad, Noah had to build an ark before there was any danger. Lot had to leave all his possessions and Jeremiah had to marry a prostitute. Esther, Morticai, Daniel, and the 3 Hebrew boys had to risk their lives. The disciples left their homes and professions to follow Jesus. Paul had to leave behind his high status and reputation. There are so many more examples of how Gods calling was less than comfortable. Time and time again, He called people out of their societal comfort zone. Time and time again, God has sought after obedience, which is the ultimate sacrifice.

Can you really say you worship something if you don’t do as it wills? Does worship not demand obedience? For example, if one worships their job, do they not have to be obedient to its hours of operation, standards, and expectations in order to remain in right standing with the idol? Even so far as to cancel other plans, risk relationships, and lose sleep, all for its sake. \
So why? Why is it so easy for most of us to be obedient to everything other than Christ? Why do most of us find excuses when it comes to what Christ has asked of us, but not when it comes to the things the world demands of us? When was the last time you were disciplined enough to walk in obedience?

If you find comfort in your job, statue, or what you do or don’t own, you’re probably doing it wrong. Our comfort should be in Christ alone.

<blockquote>
“So Samuel said: “Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, As in obeying the voice of the Lord?<strong> Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice</strong>, And to heed than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, And stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, He also has rejected you from being king.”” ‭‭<cite> 1 Samuel‬ ‭15‬:‭22‬-‭23‬ ‭NKJV</cite></blockquote>
