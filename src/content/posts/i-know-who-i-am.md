I've often gotten called a tomboy; ever since I was little and even now. Often times I used to feel I probably should have been born a boy. I always seemed to get along better with boys. I wasn't a huge fan of wearing dresses and just didn't have an affinity for a lot of feminine activities. I've gotten a few people ask me if I am gay.
</p>

<p>
While at the time I knew I wasn't gay, I wasn't as sure about my gender. I wasn't as sure about who I was. I doubted if I was even really a girl, but I also knew I wasn't a boy. I never really thought too deep about it, I just kind of learned to accept my confusion and keep going.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't until I started my journey into getting to know myself through Christ that I really started to understand and accept myself. I now know and accept that God doesn't make mistakes, because He is God. Therefore I am definitely a girl. I also know that God made me to be who He wanted me to be. Whether I like feminine or masculine things, that doesn't change the truth that I was created a woman and am a woman. But that also doesn't mean that the things I like don't matter. I can still very much like what I like, and be who I am. I am the wonderful and perfect creation of God.
</p>

<p>
Even today many people still tell me I act like a boy. I don't feel offended, I just smile knowing that they don't really understand who I am. It's not up to them to tell me who I am, because God already told me who I am. God doesn't make mistakes, but the father of lies, Satan, definitely wants us to believe otherwise. That's why I'm glad that I can be secure of my gender and personality.

What I think a lot of people don't understand is that it's not your actions that make you a specific sex or gender. Your actions are just a result of the personality that God implanted in you and how you use it. Of course, Satan will do everything he can to make sure you lose your way, but you have to also be willing to do everything you can to make sure that God remains your pillar. Read the Bible, discuss the Bible, act on the Bible and you'll find that it works.

<blockquote>
<p>You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvelous—how well I know it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed. How precious are your thoughts about me, O God. They cannot be numbered! I can’t even count them; they outnumber the grains of sand! And when I wake up, you are still with me!</p>
<cite>Psalms 139:13-18 NLT</cite>
