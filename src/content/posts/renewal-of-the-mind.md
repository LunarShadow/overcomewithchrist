As someone who has been through severe depression, I know how hard the battle is to see pass those negative thoughts the devil tries to feed us as truth. There was a point where walking through a dark tunnel seemed like all life had in store for me. But really, I had unpacked my bags there and decided that’s where I was meant to be. Besides, walking through the tunnel to see if there really was a light at the end seemed like too much work. I was content with just dying in that darkness. But when I gave my life to Christ, He showed me that I didn’t have to stay there. In fact, I could not stay there! So, I packed the important stuff, and started my journey through the tunnel with Jesus Christ as my flashlight.

Negative thoughts were something that I had to constantly fight off as I started to overcome my depression. Romans 12:2 (NLT) says “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect”. I still struggle every now and then, but now I have a tool box of scriptures I can counter my negative thoughts with. So even when I feel a little depressed or sad, I still know the truth God has told me about my situation and can work to dismiss the lies the devil wants to make me believe.

| I’m not good enough          | **'You are of God**, little children, and have overcome them, because **He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world**. '  **1 John 4:4 NKJV**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| No one loves me              | And I am convinced **that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love.** Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from God’s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.  **Romans 8:38-39 NLT**  |
| I’m a failure                | 'For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength. ' **Philippians 4:13 NLT**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| What if xyz doesn’t work out | '“**So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.** These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. Seek the Kingdom of God. above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.'  **Matthew 6:32-34 NLT**                                                                                                |
| I’m better off dead          | 'I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. **Christ died for our sins**, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. '  **1 Corinthians 15:3-4 NLT**                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Life isn’t worth it          | 'For I know the plans I have for you,” says the Lord. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen. '.  **Jeremiah 29:11-12**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

> And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise.
