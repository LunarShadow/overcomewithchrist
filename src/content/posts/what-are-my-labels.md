Everyone has a different take when it comes to the lgbtq+ community. What I need to figure out is when does love cross over to bowing down?
</p>
<p>
I understand the LGBT point of view. I used to identify as a hetero-romantic grey asexual. And if I knew about sex change and had access to it between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, I probably would have looked into doing it. But boy am I glad I didn’t have that option! I no longer feel the same way about these labels.
</p>
<p>
Not only were the labels confusing to keep up with, but they were annoying to explain and just increased the confusion within me. Now the only labels that matter to me are those that Christ has given me: king-priest, child of God, and joint-heir to the throne of God, amongst other things.
</p>
<p>
Do I think that males should go into a female bathroom because they feel they are a girl or vise versa? No. Do I think it’s okay for children to have access to sex-changing hormones? No. Do I believe my tax dollars should pay for children to change their sex? Absolutely not! Would I call a person by their preferred pronouns? Sure, but I honestly would prefer to use their name to avoid confusion. Do I think discrimination because of this is okay? No, as it just causes more division. Should we still preach to them as we would any other unsaved soul? Of course! The Holy Spirit deals with everyone individually.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, a person's personality traits do not dictate their gender, but their sex does. It doesn’t matter to me if you are male and like pink, or enjoy cooking: or if you are female and like cars, gaming, etc. Your preferences won't change the role God gave you: and you do not have to change your preferences to play the role God gave you.
</p>
<p>
I still have people who second guess my sexuality because of how I dress, behave, etc. But after correcting them in love, I let it go. I know who I am, and the world cannot take that from me.
</p>
<p>
I pray that everyone would have clarity in the truth of who they are and that they would understand God does not make mistakes. I pray against the veil of deception that is causing confusion within people: may it be lifted, allowing freedom to come through truth.
