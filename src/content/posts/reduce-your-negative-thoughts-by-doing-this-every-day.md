How often do you find yourself thinking about something negative that either causes you to be depressed or anxious? I know I still do, though not as much as I used to. One thing that helps me is meditating on scripture. Because scripture is how I fight off the lies that come to my mind.
</p>
<p>
Meditating is ruminating on or muttering something to one's self until it permeates one's spirit. Meditation also means to premeditate on an image, to ponder on a topic for the purpose of putting it to practice. So the main point of meditating on scripture is to permeate our spirit with the word of God as well as to ponder his commands to put it into practice.
</p>
<p>
Now that we know what we mean when say meditate, how does one do it? First things first, you must know why you want to meditate. What is troubling you? Are you anxious, depressed, or distressed? Whatever it is, think of a verse that deals with it. If one doesn't come up right away, stay in silence for a few minutes or speak in tongues if you are able and let the Holy Spirit lead you to a verse. However, you can always do a web search to help you out.
</p>
<p>
Once you have a verse selected that deals with your situation, it's time to go through the different levels of meditation. The first step is to set aside some time, at least 30 minutes, each day to meditate. During that time you will start by pondering quietly on the verse or verses you selected. Read it to yourself, think about what it says, think about what it doesn't say, consider how it applies to you. As you do this, you will start to understand that verse more and new revelations will come to you on the character of God and what role you play.
</p>
<p>
After pondering on the verse it's time to start muttering it to yourself. Your lips weren't moving before, but they should be now as you recite the scriptures over and over to yourself. This process helps it reach your spirit, it helps you to take it to heart. Even if you don't remember all the words of the verse, you will remember the character of God revealed in the verse when you face similar situations.
</p>
<p>
Once you've fully accepted the verse or verses to your spirit, it's time to roar it out. By this, I don't just mean scream it, but saying it loudly, confidently with a note of victory! There is victory when you understand who God is, and what role you play because in Christ we are always more than conquerors (<a>Romans 8:37</a>), hallelujah! There is a reason why the Word of God is the only offensive weapon given to us in the full armor of God (<a>Ephesians 6:13-18</a>).
</p>
<p>
As you grow your repertoire of scriptures in your heart and on your lips, you find that you can easily identify a lie being planted in your mind vs. the truth of God. The devil comes to steal, to kill, and to destroy (<a>John 10:10</a>). So resist him and he will flee from you (<a>James 4:7</a>). How do you resist? The same way Jesus did in the wilderness, with scripture (<a>Matthew 4:1-11</a>)!
