Bringing people to Christ can be a daunting task, but it's important to understand that it’s the Spirit within us that does most of the work. Once we understand that, here are other things we can do to help make the task a bit easier for us.
</p>

<h5>1. Pray</h5>
<p>
It’s always important to start with prayer. Pray for the infilling of the Holy Spirit and boldness. Pray for the salvation of the soul that you are going to touch and intercede for them before you go to speak to them. Prayer is the first and most important step, it preps you mentally for what you are trying to do and aligns you with God’s purpose.
</p>

<h5>2. Have something to give out</h5>
<p>
Once you are aligned spiritually with your task, it helps to have something to pass out. Having something like a church card, a daily devotional, a small bible or even a small informational booklet can help in giving you a reason to approach the person. It also allows you to have something to reference, especially if it’s a bible, booklet, or devotional. If the individual is receptive to the item, then strike up a conversation with them. Don’t be forceful if they don’t want to chat. Just wish time a good day, and continue on.
</p>

<h5>3. Have a couple questions in mind to ask</h5>
<p>
If they are receptive to the item, or maybe you're already in conversation with someone (without an item) it can help to have a couple of go-to questions that can bring Christ in. The question could be something like “who do you think Jesus is?” or “What do you think happens when you die?” or even “are you born again? Do you know what it means to be born again?”, then go from there. If they are already born again then great! If not, then this is your opportunity to explain, and maybe throw in some testimonies. Then lead them through the prayer of salvation if they accept and want to join the kingdom! Congratulate them for their new achievement and find a way to keep in touch with them.
</p>

<h5>4. Realize that they aren't rejecting you, but Jesus</h5>
<p>
If they don't want to hear it or are in a hurry, or sometimes even rude; try not to take it personally. They aren't rejecting you, but Jesus (<a href="#">Luke 10:16</a>). When you bring it up you are planting a seed (<a href="#">Matthew 13:1-23</a>, <a href="#">Mark 4:1-20</a>, and <a href="#">Luke 8:4-15</a>). But do not let rejection discourage you, just keep going cause God is with you. Remember you are going about your heavenly Father’s business.
