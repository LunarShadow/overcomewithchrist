<cite>Luke 18:1</cite></blockquote>

<p>
One thing I struggle with sometimes is figuring out what to pray about. It can be hard to be disciplined in my prayer life. I used to think that I only needed to pray when I had something to ask of God. The Holy Spirit has shown me this mindset is quite flawed because there are so many things to pray about! Here are a few things to consider that can help to improve your prayer life.
</p>

<h3>1. Intercession</h3>
<p>
Putting our selfish desires aside, we can come to God to stand in the gap and intercede for the unsaved. These people could be family, friends, coworkers, or strangers. Intercession is when you pray on behalf of someone else.
Paul urged Timothy to pray for the unsaved and leaders in <a>1 Timothy 2:1-2</a>. God wants all who belong to him to come to him, and sometimes he needs someone to stand in the gap for their sake (<a>Ezekiel 22:30</a>). Paul also asks for intercessory prayer in <a>2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>. You will also find many places in the Epistles where either Paul is asking for intercessory prayer or is interceding for others in the church. Thus, we should also pray for our pastor(s), church, and fellow brethren in the Lord (<a>1 Thessalonians 5:25</a>, <a>Ephesians 6:18</a>, <a>Colossians 4:13</a>). Don't forget to pray for your enemies as well (<a>Matthew 5:44</a>, <a>Romans 12:14</a>).
</p>

<h3>2. World problems</h3>
<p>
There are many evils constantly taking place in the world that could use prayer. If you need some examples, look at the news; you will get plenty. Pray for things to improve.
Whether it's scandals, rape, racism, kidnapping, sex trafficking, the state of the country, or anything else, be the person to pray about it! Be the person to start noticing and bringing it to God. Then listen and watch as things begin to change around you. Watch your community improve. Who knows, maybe God can give you an idea of how you can get involved and help with the situation you are praying about.
</p>

<h3>3. Fellowship</h3>
<p>
Another option is seeking fellowship and intimacy with God. This prayer is not about asking God for anything other than his presence. The goal is to spend time with God, to seek His face, and to know his will.
When you fellowship with the Holy Spirit, you will find yourself feeling refreshed, strengthen, and comforted. You'll gain a deeper understanding of who your God is and what His plans are for you and the world. You will also gain a better understanding of who you are because you'll see Whose you are. To me, this is one of the most powerful reasons to pray.
</p>

<p>
These are things that I've learned I can always pray about. So saying "I won't pray today because I don't know what to pray about" is no longer acceptable. Lack of a reason to pray is not a reason to not pray.
If I pray regardless of these feelings, the Holy Spirit will bring fort things to pray about. This is why it's important to learn how to pray in the Spirit (<a>Romans 8:26</a>, <a>1 Corinthians 14:</a>).
