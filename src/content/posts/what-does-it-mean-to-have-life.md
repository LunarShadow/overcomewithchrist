What does it mean to have life? This is something that I recently started to think about after I found myself thinking “I have no life”. Of course, when I was saying that, I didn’t mean that I had no physical life, I thought of it, as most of the world does, as not going out and doing “fun” things. You know, those things the world has made us believe are the benchmarks of “having a life”. As I was thinking this, the Holy Spirit asked me: “so why am I here”? It really threw me for a loop, so I sat down and thought about it: what does it mean to have (a) life?

<p>
The first verse that popped into my mind was <a>1 John 5:12</a> which says; <em>He who has the Son has life, he who has not the Son has not life</em>. Then <a>Deuteronomy 39:19</a> followed suit: <em>I have set before you <b>life</b> and death… <b>chose life</b></em>. So I took a moment and meditated on this. Later as I was doing my daily Bible reading, other verses started sticking out to me, like <a>John 3:16</a>, <em>“…so that anyone who believes in him would not perish, but have <b>everlasting life</b>”</em>. And <a>John 14:6</a> <em>“.. I am the way, the truth, and <b>the LIFE</b>”</em>. Wow, I was really amazed at this revelation.

Why would I ever say I have no life? How could I so blatantly disregard the Holy Spirit that dwells within me and gives me life? How could I show so much disrespect to Him who has done so much for me? Before writing this, I did some research and came to find the term <b>Zoe (greek: zwhv)</b> which is pronounced <em>dzo-ay</em>. One of its definitions was; <em>life real and genuine, a life active and vigorous, devoted to God, blessed, in the portion even in this world of those who put their trust in Christ, but after the resurrection to be consummated by new accessions (among them a more perfect body), and to last for ever</em>. That is the life that Christ is! Not only that, but that is the life that Christ gives! And I have this life! Glory to God forevermore!

Never again will I declare such a lie as I have no life. If you are in Christ, I urge you to do the same! Speak truth about yourself, don’t repeat the lies of the enemy. If you are not in Christ, then I urge you to read my post Ready to claim your salvation? And give yourself to Christ so you also can gain this life!
