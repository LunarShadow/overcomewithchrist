<p>For we walk by faith, not by sight.</p>
<cite>2 Corinthians 5:7</cite></blockquote>

<p>Hebrews 11 defines faith as: "The evidence of things not seen, and the substance of things hoped for". That means your faith brings to life the things you don't yet see, and it brings to existence the things you hope for. If you have faith that God will help you pay your bills, then you have evidence it will happen, without yet having the bill paid. With your faith, you bring now to reality, what you are hoping for. Hope can be defined as "a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen". Therefore, you are bringing to reality your expectations and desires through your faith.</p>

<p>Now, the opposite of faith is fear. If you are fearful then you are taking the same principles of faith, but for your own downfall. If you are fearful that you will lose your house, then you are creating evidence that the devil has the power to ruin your current situation, and therefore you are bringing into your reality what your expectations are of your current situation.</p>

<p>Do not give opportunity to the devil (<span class="tooltips">Ephesians 4:27 ESV<span class="tooltip-text">and give no opportunity to the devil.</span></span>), stand strong on the promises of God! How do you do that? The Bible says that faith come by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (<span class="tooltips">Romans 10:17 NKJV<span class="tooltip-text">So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</span></span>). So make time to read scripture, make time to listen to sermons, make feeding your spirit a priority over everything else. Then you will prove that the word is written in your heart. Let the word remain on your lips, so that you can bring light to all your situations (<span class="tooltips">Isaiah 59:21 <span class="tooltip-text">“And this is my covenant with them,” says the LORD. “My Spirit will not leave them, and neither will these words I have given you. They will be on your lips and on the lips of your children and your children’s children forever. I, the LORD, have spoken!</span></span>)!</p>

<p>In everything you do, if you aren't doing it for the glory of God, then you are doing it for Satan. You're either for the Kingdom of God or against it, point-blank. The Bible says that Satan is the god of this world (<span class="tooltips">2 Corinthians 4:4 <span class="tooltip-text">Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don’t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.</span></span>), so when we rely on the information and understanding that the world has to offer, we are opening our spirits to tainted truths and lies. This is why mind renewal is so important when we become born again. If you can spend 5hrs on YouTube or Netflix feeding your flesh, you should be able to spend that same amount of time doing something to feed your spirit and advance the kingdom of God. Besides, one has a better return on investment than the other when it comes to eternity.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.</p>
<cite>Hebrews 11:6</cite></blockquote>
