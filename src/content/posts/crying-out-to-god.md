I feel like sometimes I don't know how to cry out to God. Not because I think he's doesn't hear me, but because I just feel like a whiny little child. I don't know why I feel like I must always act strong when I'm with God. It doesn't make sense, because He already knows my heart and my thoughts (Psalm 139 'O Lord, you have examined my heart and know everything about me. You know when I sit down or stand up. You know my thoughts even when I’m far away.' 
Psalm 139:1-2 (NLT)), so why do I think I can't talk about it with Him?

This is one reason why I truly admire David. He would cry out to God for everything! If he sinned, he'd confess and beg forgiveness without caring how others perceived him (2 Samuel 12:13-17'The elders of his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he refused. David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground. After Nathan returned to his home, the Lord sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah’s wife. Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the word of the Lord by doing this, your child will die.” Then David confessed to Nathan, “I have sinned against the Lord .” Nathan replied, “Yes, but the Lord has forgiven you, and you won’t die for this sin. (NLT)). In times of difficulty, he'd cry out to God and ask him, Lord, like seriously, why is this happening to me? But even amid all his feelings, of the world around him being against him, he could always turn to God and say, even though everyone says you're no good, I know you bring joy and peace. You will deliver me! (Psalm 10 and more)
