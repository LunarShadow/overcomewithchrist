You’ve confessed Jesus as your Lord and savior as stated in <a>Romans 10:9</a>, now what? As a new believer, it can feel overwhelming trying to figure out what to do to get as close to God as the people in the faith you admire seem to be. Here are just a few places to start if you are currently in that situation. 
</p>

<h5>1. The Bible</h5>
<p>
I recommend finding the translation that works best for you. King James Version (KJV), and New King James Version (NKJV) were too hard for me to grasp easily, so I used the New International Version (NIV) for a while before I found the New Living Translation (NLT); which I find very easy to read and understand on the first read. I enjoyed the Message version (MSG) as well, but that one was a bit harder to reference since it often combined verses into paragraphs. Amplified Classic version (AMPC) gives a lot of extra details, but I get distracted easily if I'm using it to get through the Bible. When studying, I always compare between versions, usually NLT, KJV, NKJ, and AMPC. I would also recommend investing in a Study Bible.
</p>

<h5>2. Pastor and/or Church Leaders</h5>
<p>
I think reaching out to your pastor or church leaders is a great next step. They should have a lot more experience and understanding to share and they can point you to certain passages to read and meditate on. A reputable pastor, elder, or leader will also be able to provide great Godly advice on how to advance in your faith walk.
</p>

<h5>3. Christian Websites</h5>
<p>
One of my favorite places to go when I have Bible related questions is <a href="http://gotquestions.com/">gotquestions.com</a>. I think they do a great job of answering questions according to the Bible without taking verses out of context. They also have multiple scriptural verses to back up their answers. Of course, there are many other sources that can be used. Many pastors and churches have written Bible studies on topics you may be struggling with that can be found with just a web search.
</p>

<h5>4. YouTube, Podcasts and Christian Influencers</h5>
<p>
YouTube is a great place to watch sermons which can really help in broadening your understanding and at the same time see that the fundamentals of Christianity can be found in many churches (as it should). The different points of view and understandings are great for reaching different types of audiences, you never know whose explanation will finally give you that revelation you were lacking on a certain verse/section. Some of the people and churches I’ve enjoyed listening to are: Pastor Charles Stanley from In Touch Ministries, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome from Christ Embassy, Apostle Joshua Selman, Jackie Hill Perry, Focus on the Family, and The Bible Project.
