The recount of Martha hosting Jesus is a short one, but an important one. It’s a great reminder of where we should be directing our focus when in ministry.

While it seemed that Martha was doing the wrong thing, it wasn’t so much what she was doing than what she was feeling. Martha had to be corrected because her heart was not in the right place towards Mary. Instead of focusing on joyfully serving, she started to feel bitter towards Mary who seemed to be doing nothing as she sat at Jesus’ feet.

But Jesus also said one thing to Martha if you read Luke 10:41-42 from The Passion Translation; she was distracted. Don’t let your service distract you from God himself. When you serve, serve joyfully, willingly, and maintain your focus on Christ.

As Jesus pointed out, Mary chose the good part, the important part, fellowship with Christ. But that doesn’t mean that the service Martha was rendering was bad, it was just causing her to get distracted. What you do for Christ should never take more space in your heart than the time you spend with Christ. When a tree is watered, the fruits follow, so stay watered.

<blockquote>But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.”
