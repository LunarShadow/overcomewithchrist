<p>I’ve been thinking lately a lot about what it means to be born again. What does it mean to become a new creature while I am still on this earth? it’s hard to really see our new nature in the moment. It’s only when we look back at where we were, that we really see how far Jesus has taken us. After some study, here are 3 points on what it means to be a new creature (<span class="tooltips">2 Corinthians 5:17<span class="tooltip-text">This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!</span></span>).</p>

<h2>Made Righteous</h2>

<p>As a new creature, we are made right with God through Christ (<span class="tooltips">2 Corinthians 5:21<span class="tooltip-text">For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ.</span></span>). This Is an important first step because now it’s easier to go to God with our worries. We don’t have to pray feeling ashamed of things we’ve done before we knew Him. Our ability to form a relationship with God is jump-started because we are now alive to God (<span class="tooltips">Romans 6:11<span class="tooltip-text">So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.</span></span>).</p>

<h2>Become Joyful</h2>

<p>We are given joy overflowing and peace that surpasses understanding (<span class="tooltips">Philippians 4:7<span class="tooltip-text">Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.</span></span>, <span class="tooltips"> John 15:11<span class="tooltip-text">I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow!</span></span>). Jesus left us with his Joy and with it comes peace and rest. This is why in <span class="tooltips">Philippians 4:4<span class="tooltip-text">Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice!</span></span> Paul urges us to rejoice in the Lord always. Even when things get hard, we know that we can still have Joy in understanding where we’re going.</p>

<h2>Christ is in us</h2>

<p>As a new creature, we have the nature of Christ. Thanks to the Holy Spirit, we not only are able to remain in Christ, but our spirit is one with Christ’s (<span class="tooltips">Colossians 1:27<span class="tooltip-text">To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. ( KJV)</span></span>). The more we live using our new nature, the deeper our relationship with the Holy Spirit can become and the more like Christ we become (<span class="tooltips">Colossians 3:10<span class="tooltip-text"> Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him.)</span></span>.</p>

<p>For these to manifest in your life, you must know you have it and use it. That’s why Paul says we need to renew our minds (<span class="tooltips">Romans 12:2<span class="tooltip-text">Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.</span></span>). Renewing our minds, helps us to know God’s will for us in his kingdom. So, if you are born again, know that these are just a few things that are now available to you.</p>

<p>Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy.</p>
