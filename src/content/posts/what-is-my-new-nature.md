<p>For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking lately a lot about what it means to be born again. What does it mean to become a new creature while I am still on this earth? it’s hard to really see our new nature in the moment. It’s only when we look back at where we were, that we really see how far Jesus has taken us. After some study, here are 3 points on what it means to be a new creature (<a>2 Corinthians 5:</a>).</p>

<h5>Made Righteous</h5>

<p>As a new creature, we are made right with God through Christ (<a>2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). This Is an important first step because now it’s easier to go to God with our worries. We don’t have to pray feeling ashamed of things we’ve done before we knew Him. Our ability to form a relationship with God is jump-started because we are now alive to God (<a>Romans 6:11</a>).</p>

<h5>Become Joyful</h5>

<p>We are given joy overflowing and peace that surpasses understanding (<a>Philippians 4:7</a>, <a> John 15:11</a>). Jesus left us with his Joy and with it comes peace and rest. This is why in <a>Philippians 4:4</a> Paul urges us to rejoice in the Lord always. Even when things get hard, we know that we can still have Joy in understanding where we’re going.</p>

<h5>Christ is in us</h5>

<p>As a new creature, we have the nature of Christ. Thanks to the Holy Spirit, we not only are able to remain in Christ, but our spirit is one with Christ’s (<a>Colossians 1:27</a>). The more we live using our new nature, the deeper our relationship with the Holy Spirit can become and the more like Christ we become (<a>Colossians 3:10</a>.</p>

<p>For these to manifest in your life, you must know you have it and use it. That’s why Paul says we need to renew our minds (<a>Romans 12:2</a>). Renewing our minds, helps us to know God’s will for us in his kingdom. So, if you are born again, know that these are just a few things that are now available to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy.</p>
<cite>Ephesians 4:23-24 NLT</cite>
